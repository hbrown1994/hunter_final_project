      <h1>Statement</h1>
        <p>
          The sounds you are hearing on this web page are mp3 files that were encoded using the raw html code from each website they are associated with on this page. They contain a harsh, hyper-digital, and gritty sound quality that directly juxtaposes the clean and sterile visual aesthetic of these social media websites. With the use of VR-style image rendering, the user is immersed and encircled by the magnified, abstracted, and claustrophobic details of both the sound and images. I havenâ€™t had a social media account or profile for about three years now. This is because these social media sites felt clinical and claustrophobic. I felt detached from myself, which I think is a result of how these companies want us to present ourselves in how they design their products, like we are products in clean plastic boxes posted upon a pristine white shelf; ready for retail. These sounds of the raw html data juxtaposed with altered and unaltered images of these social media sites is a way for me to reclaim these spaces for myself. This stark juxtaposition points to how harshness and oppressiveness can result from an something that appears to be unoffensive and pedestrian.
